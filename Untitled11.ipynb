        "The main aim of this project is to analyse and predict the sale of an Apple product i.e. iPad. Apple has produced several products such as iPad's, iPhone's, smartwatch, smart TV, Desktop, Mac Books, iPod etc. Among these, this brand experiences its maximum productivity and sales from the Mac Books and iPhone's. Later comes the iPad. Even though most of its features are similar to the iPhone, it doesn't expect more sales by this product. The only difference between the iPad and iPhone is the insertion of sim option. So, through this project, we analyse the sales of iPhone and iPad and then aim to enhance the sales of the iPad's similar to the sales of the iPhone. This can be achieved through the research of past sales record. The vital objective of this project is to minimize or reduce the financial capital to the Apple. By reviewing this product, financial losses can be eliminated and thus benefit the company by huge returns of the sales, increase its brand name in the business market, have a strong likeliness in the society for the future launch of new products. All these can be achieved through the process of sentiment analysis on the tweets by the public. By this sentiment analysis, the sentiments of the public i.e. the tweets are classified into positive, negative and neutral. All the tweets are extracted with the hashtag \"#iPad\" and \"#iPhone\".\n",

So, in order to achieve our aim i.e. to improve the sales of iPad's when compared with iPhone's sales, I have considered an approach of sentiment analysis. For this approach, I have collected the data from twitter i.e. the tweets of the public and classify them into positive, negative and neutral words based on the dictionary words. Through this analysis, our key objective to develop a methodology which predicts the outcomes of the iPad sales, thus creating a positive environment in the company as well.

        "\n",
        "The brand Apple was founded by the \"Steve Jobs\" in the year 1964, which is one of the top technological companies in the world. Apple has produced several products such as iPad's, iPhone's, smartwatch, smart TV, Desktop, Mac Books, iPod etc. Among these, this brand experiences its maximum productivity and sales from the Mac Books and iPhone's. Later comes the iPad. Even though most of its features are similar to the iPhone, it doesn't expect more sales by this product. If we examine the data, we can see the downfall of sales from the year 2014. This was a typical moment for the company as they experienced the death of their CEO and the founder as well as the downfall of the sales. So, in order to retain their brand name back, they have searched for the new markets. Through this project, I tried to understand how Apple tried to meet their brand demand and also manage the business industry (Apple Computer Inc., 2006).\n",
        "\n",
        "The company has to face the downfall of sales from 25 million units to 11 million units. The reason under this downfall of the sales needs to be identified by an approach called twitter sentiment analysis. As we all know how powerful social media platforms these days are. So, I have considered the social media platform i.e. twitter for my project. Using this, I will collect the tweets of the public and classify them into the dictionary, which are described in the later parts of the project report.\n",

        "\n",
        "The above figure 3 explains to us about the iPad sales between the timeline of quarter 3rd of 2010 to quarter 3rd of 2018. From this graph, we can observe the rise and downfall of the sales from 2010 to 2018 and 2012 to 2016 respectively. From the past three quarters, 33.83 million iPads were sold by Apple in the whole world. When compared to the sales in the year 2107 this is less. In a single year, 43.75 million iPads were sold. \n",
        "\n",
        "In 2010, Apple has introduced its first-generation iPad series with a touch screen and a virtual keyboard. iPhones are the new growth of technology in the smartphone market. From the first-generation to till date there are six versions of iPad's which runs with the platform of iOS. iOS was also developed by Apple and stands as the world's second-best popular operating system. Since the year 2010, a drastic number of iPads i.e. about 350 million iPads were sold globally. Apple has increased its market share to 15 per cent by the end of the year 2017 (Apple, 2018). By launching iPad air in the year 2013, November the sales of these iPads were more than 26 million times than the sales of iPads from the year 2013. These sales were highest until 2014.\n",
        "\n",

By these tweets, we can understand the user concerns and feeling more clearer and try to implement them in the future versions of the iPad.

        "The existing approach that Apple follows is the \"Judgmental approach\". In this approach, the organization set-ups an end goal in the process of estimating the demand. In this process, people suggest their opinions to achieve the final target (Apple Computer Inc., 2006). Using this methodology great innovations were made which helped the brand to be the top in the business world market.\n",

Through this process, the customer details and preferences are collected and then examined individually for the specific outcome. They also consider the past sales record for this. The crucial customers for this kind of analysis are the customers of other organisations such as HP, Samsung, Dell etc. The only reason for considering these companies is as they are in manufacturing history from the past years and have good knowledge about the customer needs in laptops, tablets etc.\n",

As well know how powerful social media platforms these days are. So, I have considered the social media platform i.e. twitter for my project.

        "For the successful implementation of this project, I planned to use the R programming language. To this, we execute programming in RStudio. The initial step is to extract the tweets from twitter by using the hashtag #iPad. As soon as we finish this extraction, the second next step is to clean the dataset i.e. to the elimination of stop words, URL's, numbers and punctuations. After this step, the data is analysed by applying various classifiers such as K-NN, Naive-Bayes. All this classification will be executed in a tool called Orange.\n",

        "The first step is to build the training set. This has both the positive and negative words which are considered as 1 and 0 respectively. As soon as the training set is built in the Orange, we can use it as the testing dataset. Through this dataset, we analyse our predictions. Next step is to analyse the sentiments of the tweets which can then we validated in a ratio. If the negative words are more i.e. if the ratio is high, then we need to analyse the product based on the comments so that we can increase our sales in the future products. Word count is used to pairing the frequently used words with the hashtag. This is also done in RStudio.\n",

So, after identifying the reason, we need to fix them.
